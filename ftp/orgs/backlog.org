*** Questions
     - How to understand "Haskell types are sets and functions are
       math function"?
       - Object has 0 type Void
       - Object has 1 type unit/()
       - Object has 2 types True | False, type Boolean
       - Monoid category only has one Object

     - isomorphisim

     - Keleis Category
*** Interesting quotes

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In the ideal world we would just say that Haskell types are sets and
Haskell functions are mathematical functions between sets.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
That means we do reason about programs we write, and we usually do it
by running an interpreter in our heads. It’s just really hard to keep
track of all the variables. Computers are good at running programs —
humans are not! If we were, we wouldn’t need computers.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For our limited purposes, a Kleisli category has, as objects, the
types of the underlying programming language. Morphisms from type A to
type B are functions that go from A to a type derived from B using the
particular embellishment. Each Kleisli category defines its own way of
composing such morphisms, as well as the identity morphisms with
respect to that composition.
