<h1 class="title">Blogspot came back to China!?</h1>
</header><p>
Blogspot was blocked again in China mainland. Maybe the reason was some
political words about TaiWan and Tibet.
But today we can access this site again. Good news for our Chinese users
I think.

Release One is almost completed of our project and project manager was
back to U.S.
This was the first time for me to work with foreign people and we did
practice much English.
Even though my speaking English just got a little progress. And I felt
disappointed.
So there&rsquo;s a long way to be good English learner.

What have done this week:
Spend one more day to try to fix out the UI bugs in Pentaho and
failed.
Prepare documents about configure Pentaho Server and deploy BIRT
report.
And these documents partly conclude what we have done in this month.
During preparing documents,I found two of UI bugs were very easy to be
fixed.
I&rsquo;m not sure why failed to do it several days ago.Maybe just because of
quiet and patient.
