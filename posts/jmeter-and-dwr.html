I just follow
<a href="http://jorge.martincuervo.com/2006/10/15/jmeter-and-dwr/">this</a>
article to test DWR request in JMeter.<br>
To tell the truth, I didn&rsquo;t get its content very well. I had no choice
but read a second time and went through all comments.<br>
So I decided to give a try in my desktop. Eventually I worked it out and
now I can test DWR request.
</p>

<p>
Two important and great thing the author dig out is how to get
httpSessionId and scriptSessionId for a DWR request.<br>
Request for engine.js and use Regular Expression Extractor to get the
scriptSessionId.<br>
But this regular expression is for DWR2.0. Follow the link at the last
to see a regular expression for latest DWR.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org030770f">
 `dwr.engine._origScriptSessionId  = "(.*)";`double quotes work instead of single quotes for me.  
   
For the httpSessionId, I got it from the Http Cookie Manager in the thread group, with the expression ${JSESSIONID}  
   
One thing I forgot is DWR request method is 'POST', but not 'GET' which is the default value when adding a new Http Request.
