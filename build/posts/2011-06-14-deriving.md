# Deriving
What the cool thing that Deriving does is actually **automaticlly implementing instance** for perticular type class.

For instance, a `Person` derives `Eq`

~~~~~
data Person = Person { firstName :: String, 
                       lastName  :: String, 
                       age       :: Int }
                     deriving (Eq)
~~~~~

Then we are able to compare two Persons because Haskell make the type `Person` to be a instance of typeclass `Eq`.

Take another example,

~~~~~
data Day = Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday
           deriving (Bounded, Enum)
~~~~~

The `Bounded` typeclass defines things that have lowest possible value and highest possible value.
The `Enum` typeclass defines things that have predecessors and successors.

Let's read one of function in `Bounded` typeclass `minBound`, which just return something that is instance of `Bounded`.

~~~~~
minBound :: (Bounded a) => a
~~~~~

Hence, if enforce its return type to be `Day`, we will get result

~~~~~
ghci> minBound :: Day  
Monday 
~~~~~

Take a look at one function of `Enum` typeclass

~~~~~
succ :: (Enum a) => a -> a
~~~~~

We could easy guess the result of `succ Tuesday` will be Wednesday.

Thanks a guy point me I could go further by study [Data.derive](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/derive) at the beginner mailing session.
