  - when u let the [nose of the camel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel%27s_nose) into the tent, the rest of him will follow

> They're saying that if you have a method completely free of state management or side effects itself
> If that method invokes any other method , the ability to reason about our state free method is no longer simple
> You introduce a small thing (calling a function that changes state of some unrelated object, the nose of a camel into a tent)
> And it will quickly take over -- your methods complexity is now significant and your tent is full of camel feces and spit
