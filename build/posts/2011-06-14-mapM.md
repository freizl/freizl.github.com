# How to understand the following computation result?

~~~~~
Prelude> mapM id [Just 1, Nothing, Just 3]
Nothing
~~~~~

# 'Reason about'

~~~~~
mapM     :: (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]
id       :: a -> a
sequence :: (Monad m) => [m a] -> m [a]
~~~~~~

Therefore,

~~~~~
> a = Maybe Int
> m = Maybe
> b = Int
~~~~~~

the mapM and sequence is implemented like this:

~~~~~
mapM f xs = sequence (map f xs)

sequence (c:cs) = do x  <- c
                     xs <- sequence cs
                  return (x:xs)
~~~~~

Hence the result could be understood in such way

~~~~~
  mapM id [Just 1, Nothing, Just 3]
= sequence (map id [Just 1, Nothing, Just 3])
= sequence [Just 1, Nothing, Just 3]
= do { x <- Just 1; xs <- sequence [Nothing, Just 3]; return (x:xs) }
= ...
= Just 1 >>= \x -> Nothing >>= \y -> Just 3 >>= \z -> return (x:y:z)
= Nothing          -- Because Nothing >>= ... produce Nothing
~~~~~~
